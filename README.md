# Program Runner
A CLI tool I made for my new laptop which uses Arch Linux
Warning... I'm fairly sure this won't work outside of my laptop

I made this because I thought it would be cool to open Roblox (using [Sober](https://sober.vinegarhq.org/)) from the terminal.
It also has the ability to open [Konsole](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Konsole), a KDE terminal emulator, [Kitty](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Kitty), a GPU-based terminal emulator, and [Spotify](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Spotify), an app for listening to music
