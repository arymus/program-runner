# Program Runner
A CLI tool I made for my new laptop which uses Arch Linux
Warning... I'm fairly sure this won't work outside of my laptop

I made this because I thought it would be cool to open Roblox (using [Sober](https://sober.vinegarhq.org/)) from the terminal.
It also has the ability to open [Konsole](https://konsole.kde.org/), a KDE terminal emulator as well as [Kitty](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty), a GPU-based terminal emulator
